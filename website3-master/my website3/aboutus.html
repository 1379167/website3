    <p class="par">As we head for our 34th anniversary, The Nicholson Academy Of Performing Arts is probably the most successful family-run dance school in the area.
The school’s principal Natasha Zauscinski is a Licentiate member of the International Dance Teachers Association and a member by mutual consent of the Royal Academy of Dance.
Formed in 1982 and operating as ‘The Brenda Lee School Of Dance’, the stage for future success was set for the next generation of up and coming professionals.

  <p class="par">Our main classes are held at Wharf Point, opposite the Concord Suite in Droylsden. This is where we actively take part in the transformation of the lives of students from various regeneration areas.
Situated in Droylsden and minutes away from the M60, the Nicholson Academy Of Performing Arts is easily accessed by neighbouring parts of Tameside and Manchester. Pupils often have only a short distance to travel, along with knowing that they have the quality, experience and affordability required in modern dance.
